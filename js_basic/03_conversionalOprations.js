let yourAge = 31; // its number because its without ""

//console.log(yourAge);
//console.log(typeof yourAge);

// supposed that we write number with ""  its become string

// yourAge ="31a" //  number in string format
// console.log(typeof yourAge);

// now we always want to treat yourAge as number we do

let ageInNumber = Number(yourAge); // Number , String, Boolen start with capital for conversion

//console.log(yourAge);
//console.log(typeof yourAge);

// console.log(typeof ageInNumber);
// console.log(ageInNumber)

// NaN not a number
